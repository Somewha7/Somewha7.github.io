##The Standard Pros and Cons
	Despite the perception that they can be a bother or a bore, I believe most people would agree that coding standards, at their core, are useful to writing good, legible code. People may complain that semantic decisions such as how many spaces in an indent are arbitrary and unnecessary, however far fewer would complain about the improved readability and comprehensibility of code which follows 1 standard. Furthermore, if all the code you interact with in a language follows one standard, not only do you improve at reading that language's code as a whole, but also specifically at comprehending code written using that standard. Similarly to learning a foreign language, if you have a statement to make and every statement of that form is made using that template, it may be stiffer than actual spoken language but it is also much easier to follow -- especially when you are first learning the language. Fortunately, unlike spoken languages, in coding you don't have to worry about the connotations of your word choices, politeness, or anything else -- merely the syntax and grammar of what you're saying. Additionally, while it may seem like a pain having to deal with errors that don't actually impede your code's ability to run, having to glance over everything anyways makes it much easier to remember to take a second glance over what you've written, which is never a bad idea.
	However, these benefits are most pronounced when all the code you interact with follows a single standard -- when you interact with more standards, the benefits becomes less pronounced as you never get as much time to learn each individual standard as if there was only one. Furthermore, the negatives become more pronounced, as you have to remember which standard demands which arbitrary amount of whitespace and other such minor semantics. When you only need to keep track of one standard, that's not so bad, but as you try to learn more and more standards for a single language your grievances with those semantics grow in turn. While most languages stick to a couple of main standards -- mainly in order to cover the full span of current and deprecated versions -- and as such the tradeoffs aren't so harsh, the possibility remains looming in people's heads when they think about coding standards. Ultimately though, I believe they are a useful tool, and more than worth following when writing code.

##ESLint Experiences and IDEA introductions
	So far, my introduction to IntelliJ IDEA and ESLint has been smooth. It took a while to get my initial set-up done and a little finagling in order to get my preferred color scheme set up in the IDE, but once I had it all set up I was more than happy to move back out of coding in the browser. It's just much more pleasant to be able to work on a more modifiable and in depth setup. ESLint's no more annoying than any other linter I've used in the past, and overall I would just say it's been business as usual.
