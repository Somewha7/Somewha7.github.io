summary: A terminal-based ASCII text game developed with Python for the Honolulu Global Game Jam 2018
---

Push the Button is a text game which runs in the terminal, satirizing the missle scare that occured in Hawaii in 2018. 
It's split into 4 different levels, and you progress through the various levels by poking around to discover various passwords and logging in to new accounts.
Ultimately, you're presented with a button. 
Whether to push it or not is left up to you.

Here's a couple of images of the game!

Whoops! Maybe you shouldn't have pushed the button after all...

Push the Button was designed over the course of 2 days for the Honolulu Global Game Jam of 2018, a short and sweet jam where you make a small game over the course of one weekend.
I mostly helped with the creation of level 1, in which the player uses simplified versions of several terminal commands to traverse a fake desktop and find a password to use to progress to the next level.
At the time of building this little game, I was a rank beginner at coding in general, so this project was my first real introduction to working with code that functioned over multiple files.
