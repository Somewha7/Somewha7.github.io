Roommate Radar is a website deisgned to help current UH Manoa students find others to live with off campus.
Users are able to look through the list of every other account on the site, filter to their preferences, and acquire other users' socials to message them with.
I wrote a significant portion of the GitHub page detailing the project, did a significant amount of work developing the site itself, and did much of the planning and issue creation.
With regards to the site itself, I most of the a lot of back end work, and a decent bit of the front end work.
On the back end side, I set up the MongoDB collections, defined default data that was used for much of the project, deployed the website, set up https and the domain name, and implemented tests and continuous integration.
On the front end, I didn't create much from scratch, but I helped refine the pages that others made -- especially the forms, and the user profile page.
In working on this project, I learned a lot about working with others on a website, how to define issues in ways that are easiest for the people who work on them to understand, and how to work with the back end of websites.
We had learned about working with the back end prior to starting this project, but working on it without having a set of instructions to refer to was very helpful for furthering my understanding.
More details can be found at [here](https://roommate-radar.github.io) at its github page, and the site can be found [here](https://roommate-radar.com) for as long as it remains running on Digital Ocean.
If the site is no longer being maintained, a local version of it may be ran using the steps in the Develop Guide portion of the github page.
